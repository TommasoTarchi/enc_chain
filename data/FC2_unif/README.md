## Two-layers fully connected NN architecture - Uniform disribution

In this directory you can find data gathered using a two-layers
fully connected architecture for both encoder and decoder of each 
VAE of the chain, trained on an initial dataset made of images 
with pixels turned on with uniformly distributed coordinates.

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the
regularization constant in the loss function is set to 1).
