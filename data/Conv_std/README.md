## Convolutional NN architecture - Less regularization and modified st. dev.

In this directory you can find data gathered using a 
convolutional architecture for both encoder and decoder of 
each VAE of the chain and a more spread distribution than
the standard normal for the latent space during generative
mode.

In particular, the standard deviation of the latent space 
distribution is set to ... .

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the 
coordinates of the pixels turned on in the original dataset 
are distributed according to binomial distributions, and the 
regularization constant in the loss function is set to 1).
