## Convolutional NN architecture - Uniform distribution

In this directory you can find data gathered using a convolutional
architecture for both encoder and decoder of each VAE of the chain,
trained on an initial dataset made of images with pixels turned on
with uniformly distributed coordinates.

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the
regularization constant in the loss function is set to 1).
