## Convolutional NN architecture with less regularization, variability loss and denoising

In this directory you can find data gathered using a convolutional
architecture for both encoder and decoder of each VAE of the chain,
with reduced regularization term, variability loss and denoising 
(in particular, the regularization constant is set to 0.7, 
variability loss constant to 10 and denoising threshold to 5%).
