## Convolutional NN architecture - Less regularization

In this directory you can find data gathered using a 
convolutional architecture for both encoder and decoder of 
each VAE of the chain, and a reduced regularization term
for the loss function used in the training.

In particular, the regularization constant is set to 0.3.

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the 
coordinates of the pixels turned on in the original dataset are 
distributed according to binomial distributions).
