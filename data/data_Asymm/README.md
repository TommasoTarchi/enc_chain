## Data\_Asymm

In this directory you can find data gathered using a 
convolutional architecture for the encoder and a two-layer
fully connected architecture for the decoder of each VAE 
of the chain.

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the
regularization constant in the loss function is set to 1).
