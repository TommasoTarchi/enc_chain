## Asymmetric NN architecture

In this directory you can find data gathered using a 
convolutional architecture for the encoder and a two-layer
fully connected architecture for the decoder of each VAE 
of the chain.

All other parameters are set to default (in particular the 
coordinates of the pixels turned on in the original dataset are 
distributed according to binomial distributions, and the 
regularization constant in the loss function is set to 1).
