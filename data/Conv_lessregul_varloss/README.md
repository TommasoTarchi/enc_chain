## Convolutional NN architecture with less regularization and variability loss

In this directory you can find data gathered using a convolutional
architecture for both encoder and decoder of each VAE of the chain,
with reduced regularization term and variability loss (in particular, 
the regularization constant is set to 0.7 and variability loss 
constant to 10).
