## Convolutional NN architecture with variance increment and denoising - longer chain

In this directory you can find data gathered using a convolutional
architecture for both encoder and decoder of each VAE of the chain,
and a wider latent space distribution for data generation (in 
particular the increment is set to  and denoising threshold to 5%).

The simulation is this time run on a longer chain (50 models).
