## What is this all about

The aim of the project will be that of investigating the effect of training
variational autoencoders on synthetic datasets.

This will be achieved by building a 'chain' of autoencoders, each one trained
on a dataset generated by the previous one.
The first autoencoder of the chain will be trained on an 'ad hoc' dataset made
of grids in which pixels are turned on according to a given distribution.

It will be interesting to analyse whether the notion of distribution that
humans have is the same that is recognized by the machine.

Whether the project's aim makes sense or not is highly debatable (I still have
to figure it out).
